# Rohan Prashant Adat

> **Full-Stack Engineer | AI Systems Specialist**
> *Building systems that handle chaos, not just CRUD.*

I engineer low-latency architectures and integrate generative AI into real-time financial systems. My focus is on optimizing data throughput, reducing rendering latency, and building "Spike" projects that push technical boundaries.

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

* **Languages:** Java (Core/Adv), JavaScript (ES6+), SQL, Python.
* **System Architecture:** Spring Boot Microservices, REST API Optimization, WebSocket Streaming.
* **AI Engineering:** Multimodal RAG, Google Vertex AI, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Vector Logic.
* **Frontend Performance:** React.js (Custom Batching/Throttling), Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3).

### 🚀 Featured Engineering

#### [QuantumTrader](https://github.com/rohan4852/QuantumTrader) (Manifest V3 Chrome Extension)
* **The Challenge:** Real-time chart analysis requires correlating visual patterns with live market data without latency.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a **parallel orchestrator** that captures video, fetches Finnhub market data, and runs Gemini 1.5 Pro inference concurrently.
* **The Result:** Reduced signal generation time to **<6 seconds** with zero DOM injection.

#### [TradeFlowAI](https://github.com/rohan4852/TradeFlowAI) (React + WebSockets)
* **The Challenge:** Streaming 50+ market updates/second caused massive UI freezing and react re-render loops.
* **The Solution:** Implemented a custom **throttling and batching algorithm** to decouple data ingestion from UI painting.
* **The Result:** Zero UI lag during high-volatility events.

### 📜 Research & Publications

* **"Development of an Assured Contract Farming System"** (ISBN: 978-81-985983-3-2)
    * *TechNova 2025*: Documented system architecture for secure financial transaction flows in agricultural markets.

### 🏆 Certifications

* **Google Cloud Gen AI:** Multimodal RAG & Vertex AI.
* **Microsoft AI:** AI App Development.
* **HackerRank:** Java (Silver Badge).
